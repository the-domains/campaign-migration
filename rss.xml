            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f83450408b8ae969aa617e22dc894484/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481060213_1280x720.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd35d86c6f1815ff301b89ff31df46ba5d96e829.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
